# Java
- Project No. 1 - Create 2 functions
- BRIEF - In your Java file create a class and two functions, one for string and one for integer. The String will take in a user input – the output will be: Your name is <name>. Your surname is <surname>. The integer function will take in an integer input from a user and multiply it by 3 – the output will be: Your number is n. Triple n is x.
- USING JAVA/INTELLIJ IN VISUAL STUDIO CODE
- SUDO CODE - #create a class called Functions
              #create main function for string and int functions to run from
              #function for my string
              #create Scanner class object to read inputs
              #outputs to terminal
              #function for my integer
              #create Scanner class object to read inputs
              #outputs to terminal
- CHALLENGES FACED - As this was the first time using Java, it took a while to get used to the new language. I felt like this was the most challenging language yet as there was a lot I did not yet understand. 
- HOW I OVERCAME THIS CHALLENGE - I read over our session notes quite a lot so that I could understand the new syntax as most of it did not look like anything I had come across before. 

- Project No. 2 - Switch calculator
- BRIEF - Create a calculator using the switch statement
- USING JAVA/INTELLIJ IN VISUAL STUDIO CODE
- SUDO CODE - #create a class called Calculator
              #create main function 
              #declare variables
              #create Scanner class object to read inputs
              #read operators
              #switch case statements
- CHALLENGES FACED - Again as I was still fairly new to this language it was an adjustment to find the correct ways to write this piece of code.
- HOW I OVERCAME THIS CHALLENGE - I did lots of reading and finally figured out what I needed to make the switch statements work as a calculator.
