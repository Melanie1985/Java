# Java
- Project No. 1 - Create 2 functions
- BRIEF - In your Java file create a class and two functions, one for string and one for integer. The String will take in a user input – the output will be: Your name is <name>. Your surname is <surname>. The integer function will take in an integer input from a user and multiply it by 3 – the output will be: Your number is n. Triple n is x.
- USING JAVA/INTELLIJ IN VISUAL STUDIO CODE
- SUDO CODE - #create a class called Functions
              #create main function for string and int functions to run from
              #function for my string
              #create Scanner class object to read inputs
              #outputs to terminal
              #function for my integer
              #create Scanner class object to read inputs
              #outputs to terminal
- CHALLENGES FACED - As this was the first time using Java, it took a while to get used to the new language. I felt like this was the most challenging language yet as there was a lot I did not yet understand. 
- HOW I OVERCAME THIS CHALLENGE - I read over our session notes quite a lot so that I could understand the new syntax as most of it did not look like anything I had come across before. 

- Project No. 2 - Switch calculator
- BRIEF - Create a calculator using the switch statement
- USING JAVA/INTELLIJ IN VISUAL STUDIO CODE
- SUDO CODE - #create a class called Calculator
              #create main function 
              #declare variables
              #create Scanner class object to read inputs
              #read operators
              #switch case statements
- CHALLENGES FACED - Again as I was still fairly new to this language it was an adjustment to find the correct ways to write this piece of code.
- HOW I OVERCAME THIS CHALLENGE - I did lots of reading and finally figured out what I needed to make the switch statements work as a calculator.

- Project No. 3 - Selection Sort
- BRIEF - You’ve got an array below called Revenue – use the selection sort algorithm to print to the console the largest value. Revenue: 150.00, 200.00, 154.98, 335.01, 475.12, 555.87, 216.38 Output is “The largest value is £n”
- USING JAVA/INTELLIJ IN VISUAL STUDIO CODE
- SUDO CODE - #create a class called SelectionSort
              #create main function 
              #declare array with double data type
              #call selection sort routine
              #print sorted array
              #selection sort algorithm
- CHALLENGES FACED - Getting to grips with this new algorithm took a while but our tutor took us though it a few times and it started to make some sense.
- HOW I OVERCAME THIS CHALLENGE - I practiced using this algorithm a few times with different arrays. 

- Project No. 4 - Bubble Sort
- BRIEF - Using the list below sort the numbers using Bubble Sort, then ask a user for an input if the input is within the list then the output to the terminal will be: Output is: “we found x counts of n”. It will then print the sorted list. Numbers = 34, 2, 10, 6, 7, 5, 1, 5
- USING JAVA/INTELLIJ IN VISUAL STUDIO CODE
- SUDO CODE - #create a class called BubbleSort1
              #bubble sort algorithm
              #create main function 
              #declare variables
              #create a scanner class object to read inputs
              #use for loop to determine how many counts of user input there is in the array
              #sorting array elements using bubble sort
- CHALLENGES FACED - I struggled with this function as I could not work out how to get the for statement to fins how many times a certian number appeared in my list.
- HOW I OVERCAME THIS CHALLENGE - Once again the answer was in where I placed my count, after a few different tries I cracked it.
